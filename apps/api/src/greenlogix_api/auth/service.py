"""Authentication service and token/PIN verification.

PROD GATE (T-LOOP-AUTH): global PIN ``0000``, ``driver_<plate>`` PINs, and
``Bearer DEMO`` are demo-only. They are accepted ONLY when
``GREENLOGIX_DEMO=1``; any other value (including unset) returns 401.
No routing changes; no frozen-path changes.

PIN lockout (C-01, enforced): failed ``X-Driver-Pin`` attempts are counted
in-memory per client IP + PIN within ``PIN_LOCKOUT_SECONDS``; once
``MAX_PIN_ATTEMPTS`` is reached the key returns 429 until the window
expires. Successful authentications are never counted, so the demo-OK path
is unaffected. Production must replace the dict with a shared store
(e.g. Redis); the fail-closed DEMO gate above stays authoritative.
