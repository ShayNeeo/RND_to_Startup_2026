"""Reference solvers for the benchmark harness (CR-11, T-LOOP-HARNESS).

Wraps in-repo heuristics only — no new dependencies, no PyVRP/OR-Tools.
Both solvers are deterministic; ``seed`` is accepted and recorded so the
harness table is reproducible, but the heuristics themselves use no RNG
(NN tie-break is by window_start, then input order).
